A website that allows users to leave reviews for Video Games, as well for admins to add games for users to review. 

Tech Used: 
Built using React, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB as the main tech, while using frameworks such as Bootstrap for CSS, Multer to allow image file download when Admin's add a game for review, and Axios to interact with the API

Current Features:
Login Registration - Allows users to create an account and log in, as well as ties reviews to users so only the user who created the review, or an admin, may edit or delete a review.

Reviews - User's can browse the list of games from the home menu, and when the find a game which they want to review, they can go to the game page where it will have a form for the user to enter their review to appear on the game's page for other users to see, as well as the ability to edit your previous reviews, and delete them.

Games - The site admin account can add games with the game's Name, Systems it's on, and an image for the game. The games will then all populate on a list on the home page for users to browse and decide which game they would like to review. Admin's can also delete games from the home page.
